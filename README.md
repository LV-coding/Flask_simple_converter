# PDF to MP3
The project is written in Flask, deployed. 
The [site](https://simple--converter.herokuapp.com) accepts files in pdf and txt formats as an input file, converts them to mp3 (automatic voiceover) and gives them to the user. 
Voiceover files are stored on the server for 10 minutes and then deleted.
